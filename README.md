# buck_converter

This project is a 12V to 6V DC-DC buck converter. I first simulated it in MATLAB and then designed the PCB for potential hardware implementation.

After learning about DC-DC converters in class (buck, boost, buck-boost), I wanted to design a buck converter myself. I also needed a buck converter for a project I’m working on, so this was a perfect opportunity.

While designing this converter, I learned a lot of practical concepts that aren’t covered in class, and it helped me understand the theoretical concepts much better.
